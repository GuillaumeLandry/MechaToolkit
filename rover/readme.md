# Rover
Robot avoiding collision with sonar and OLED display. When it comes within 20cm range of an obstacle, it stops, goes backwards, turns left, then goes forward again until the next obstacle. RC receiver and camera motor controlled mount are displayed on the robot for future improvements.

Run Robot.ino sketch for full robot functionalities. Otherwise, independent script for OLED display with sonar is also available for independent use.
